using command line
---------------------
1.TO initialize a ts project you can use the command "npm init -y"
and the the command will try to make a package.json file that contains some basic configurations

2. to install the ts compiler in dev mode you use "npm i --save-dev typescript" command
and then it will create some folder called "node_modules" and package-lock.json .

3.when you create a ts file by default it has no type selection you need to run the
"npx tsc --init" to activate the typescript compiler.

4. After running the above command there will be crated a tsconfig.json file that will 
contain all the configurations regarding the typescript file you are running.

5.to compile our file we use the "npx tsc [filename]" then it will convert the ts into json

when we have the erro in the ts it will compile it ro js no matter what

to resolve that issue you addd another option called "--noEmitOnError" flag
